# Simplistics Repository by Abhishek Shah

Welcome to the **Simplistics Repository**, a collection of simple yet practical Python-based projects I have worked on to practice and enhance my programming skills. These projects are aimed at providing solutions to common tasks and games, focusing on simplicity, functionality, and code readability. All the projects were practiced using the **hackr.io** website and serve as learning tools for anyone interested in Python.

## 🚀 Goal of the Repository
The primary goal of this repository is to showcase various beginner-to-intermediate level Python projects that solve different real-world problems, automate tasks, and build basic games. Each project is self-contained, well-structured, and written in Python with a focus on understanding core programming concepts like:
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions and modularity
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Basic file handling
- User interface with Tkinter
- Game development basics

This repository serves as a reference for beginners looking to practice Python or for anyone wanting to explore simple project ideas.

## 📝 List of Projects

1. **Password Strength Checker**  
   A tool to check the strength of a password by analyzing various factors like the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Provides feedback to users about the strength of their password.

2. **Library Manager**  
   A simple library management system where users can borrow and return books. The program tracks available books and allows users to search for books and view their borrowed list.

3. **Pong Game**  
   A Python implementation of the classic Pong game using the `turtle` module. Players control paddles to hit a bouncing ball, simulating a table tennis game.

4. **The Blackjack**  
   A text-based Blackjack game where players can compete against the computer in a game of chance and strategy.

5. **Tkinter-based Hangman**  
   A GUI version of the popular Hangman game built using the Tkinter library. Players guess letters to complete a word before running out of attempts.

6. **Tkinter-based Text Editor**  
   A simple text editor with basic functionality like opening, editing, and saving text files, implemented using Tkinter. It mimics the functionality of a basic notepad.

7. **Password Generator**  
   A random password generator that creates strong, unique passwords based on user-defined length and character sets, ensuring enhanced security.

8. **Shop Calculator**  
   A calculator program designed to assist shop owners in calculating total amounts, discounts, and generating bills.

9. **Speed Typing Test**  
   A typing test game that calculates your typing speed by timing how fast you can accurately type a given text.

10. **Sudoku Solver**  
   A program that allows users to solve Sudoku puzzles by implementing a backtracking algorithm, helping users find solutions to any valid Sudoku board.
